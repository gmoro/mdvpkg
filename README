 mdvpkg - the mandriva package management daemon
=================================================

mdvpkg is a wrapper upon mandriva urpmi database to provide
non-privileged users access to package maintenance tasks (upgrade,
installing, searching). Its development was initiated to support the
implementation of Mandriva Package Manager.

The following features are aimed:

* D-Bus interface allowing the creation of specialized clients (like
  an update applet, or end-users application managers)

* Unprivileged management tasks through PolicyKit

* Support for urpmi input (like dep choices from clients)

* A command line client

* Python QT/QML widgets to manage package tasks

It's inspired on ideas from PackageKit and aptdaemon.
